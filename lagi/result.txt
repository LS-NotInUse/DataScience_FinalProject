1 :	I was a government major which means I had to write a lot of papers

2 :	now what a normal student write a paper tonight spread the work out a little like this

4 :	get started maybe a little slowly when you get enough done in the first week that was some have your days later on everything gets done think stay civil

5 :	and I would want to do that like that that would be the plan I would I would have it all ready to go but then then then that they actually the people would come along and then I kind of do this

7 :	I know what happened every single Paper

8 :	but then came my 90-page senior thesis paper supposed to spend a year on

9 :	and you for paper like that my normal workflow was not an option was way too big project so I plan things out and I decided I kind of had to go something like this

10 :	so the year ago so it start off light

11 :	and I can bump it up in the middle months

12 :	and then at the end I would kick it up the high gears little staircase how hard you just walk up the stairs

13 :	no big deal right

19 :	and I didn't really write words and so we're here

20 :	and then two months turned into one month turned into two weeks Monday woke up

21 :	3 days until the deadline still not having written the word and so I did the only thing I could I wrote a 90-page is over 72 hours pulling not one but two all-nighters humans are not supposed to pull two all nighters
